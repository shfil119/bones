pre-built coreboot (4.18) images and documentation on how to flash them for fm2, fm2+, am1 motherboards 

# Goal
Allowing easy access to prebuild images. Be aware that support for these boards was removed from coreboot releases 4.19. Using these images can cause security problems.

# Currently supported motherboards
* Asus A88XM-E
* Asus F2A85-M
* Asus F2A85-M PRO
* Asus F2A85-M LE
