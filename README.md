pre-built coreboot (4.18) images and documentation on how to flash them for fm2, fm2+, am1 motherboards 

# Goal
Allowing easy access to prebuild images. Be aware that support for these boards was removed from coreboot releases 4.19. Using these images can cause security problems.

# Currently supported motherboards
* ASUS A88XM-E
* ASUS F2A85-M
* ASUS F2A85-M2
* ASUS F2A85-M PRO
* Asus ASUS F2A85-M LE
